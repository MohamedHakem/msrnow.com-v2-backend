- When to use API routes? 
      when you need to call it from outside the site, like trigger something with a cron job or a webhook, to scrape on an interval.
      Or when you want to make a call from the client side, either API route or a Server Action
      example: related articles will be called on scroll, so it will be a server action,  
      (but if you want to get the related articles on page load with no lazy-load on scroll, then make it a util function since it's a server component.)
- When to use a util or data function instead? 
      when you need to grab some data from the db or any internal process for the website, even scraping, but not triggered by an external source.
      like a function to get all the posts from the db, or to scrape article content or related articles of an article.
